### 💼 Selected Projects & Contributions

### 📱 [Accessible iOS Translation App for Visually Impaired Users](https://apps.apple.com/kh/app/spelling-for-the-blind/id6450370752)

Contributed to the development of an iOS application for text and PDF document translation, specifically designed to support visually impaired users.

A key differentiating feature of the app is the letter-by-letter (spelling) pronunciation of translated words, enabling users to understand how words are written, not just how they sound — a capability rarely available in traditional translation apps.

Key contributions:

- Designed and implemented accessible user interfaces.

- Implemented text-to-speech spelling functionality for translated content, improving word comprehension.

- Integrated REST APIs and contributed to the development of a GraphQL API.
(GraphQL is not my primary area of expertise, but it was successfully implemented to meet project requirements).

- Conducted testing and validation using TestFlight, with a focus on accessibility and stability.

- Supported release versioning and deployment processes.

- Integrated and tested In-App Purchases (IAP).

This project combined accessibility, language technology, and mobile development, delivering meaningful impact for users with visual impairments.

### ⚖️ [Legal SaaS Platform – Document Automation & Pension Calculations](https://www.clubdealejandria.store/)

Contributed extensively to the development of a legal SaaS platform, delivering multiple features end-to-end across frontend, backend, and cloud infrastructure, with a strong focus on automation, performance, and user experience.

Key contributions:

- Designed and implemented a significant portion of the user interfaces, including:

- Admin dashboards for managing educational content (articles, books, and categories).

- End-user interfaces for consuming and navigating educational content.

- Built a dynamic, recursive category system, allowing administrators to create unlimited nested categories.
The frontend renders this structure by recursively traversing a category tree, enabling flexible and scalable content classification.

- Developed PDF report generation for a pension calculation tool, which uses React Context API for state management, enabling consistent data flow across complex calculation steps.

- Designed and implemented a custom OCR solution using Google Document AI to automatically extract data from Colombian employment history documents, reducing manual processing time by approximately 90% (from 2–2.5 hours to ~10 minutes).

- Deployed cloud functions for on-demand OCR execution, reducing hosting costs by 25%.

- Integrated multiple backend APIs, working within a hexagonal architecture–based core system.

- Implemented unit and integration tests for selected backend endpoints to ensure reliability and maintainability.

- Participated in requirements gathering and business analysis, gaining deep domain knowledge and proposing solutions that balanced developer experience and end-user usability.

This project strengthened my experience in scalable SaaS development, document automation, and business-driven software design.
